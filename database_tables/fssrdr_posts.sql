The FBI claims that the reasoning behind the decision is that it lacks the technical expertise to decipher the underlying code that facilitated hacking into the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the FBI\'s intention against launching an internal government investigation to decide whether to share the information with Apple.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to director James Comey, the FBI paid at least $1 million to an undisclosed third-party for this secret hacking tool after Apple refused to undermine the security of its own product and put customers at risk. Even though the FBI acquired the tool, federal agents are unfamiliar with how it actually works so they can’t report it to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, the government system that would determine whether there are any security weaknesses that should be reported to Apple.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhile the FBI’s million-dollar hacking tool could remain a secret, Apple told The Wall Street Journal that whatever iPhone vulnerability the tool exploited will have a “short shelf life.” Apple has vowed to continue improving the security of its products and to patch any vulnerabilities.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhy this matters: Even though the specific FBI-Apple court fight that sparked this debate has been defused, a broader back-and-forth between the government and tech companies continues. Now, it’s the government’s Vulnerabilities Equities Process that’s being put into question. In this process, intelligence agencies decide whether a specific software vulnerability needs to be disclosed to its manufacturer or the public. This decision is reached by weighing the risk of the vulnerability being exploited with the value to national security in keeping the vulnerability a secret.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe White House has said that the Vulnerabilities Equities Process is designed to help software makers patch weaknesses, but some privacy advocates argue that the process actually favors national security.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“If the government can circumvent the process merely by buying vulnerabilities, then the process becomes a farce,” Christopher Soghoian, chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, told the WSJ. “The FBI is not interested in cybersecurity.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.<br><br>','','/media/images/post-covers/post-1.png','top','text','fussraider','2017-02-05 15:40:22'),(2,'test player 1','<div class=\"play_btn\">2Pac – black nigga killa 2016</div>\r\n<div class=\"play_btn\">2Pac – I See No Changes Remix</div>\r\n<div class=\"play_btn\">2Pac  – Going Away #NEW</div>\r\n<div class=\"play_btn\">2Pac  – Starin Through My ...</div>\r\n<div class=\"play_btn\">2Pac  – Dont Cry</div>\r\n<div class=\"play_btn\">2Pac – Lord Knows</div>','','/media/images/post-covers/post-2.png','top','player','fussraider','2017-01-11 20:36:41'),(3,' Fahrenheit 451','Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by Ray Bradbury, published in 1953. It is regarded as one of his best works. The novel presents a future American society where books are outlawed and \"firemen\" burn any that are found. The book\'s tagline explains the title: \"Fahrenheit 451 -- the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns ...\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe novel has been the subject of interpretations focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas. In a 1956 radio interview, Bradbury stated that he wrote Fahrenheit 451 because of his concerns at the time (during the McCarthy era) about the threat of book burning in the United States. In later years, he described the book as a commentary on how mass media reduces interest in reading literature.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1954, Fahrenheit 451 won the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature and the Commonwealth Club of California Gold Medal. It has since won the Prometheus \"Hall of Fame\" Award in 1984 and a 1954 \"Retro\" Hugo Award, one of only four Best Novel Retro Hugos ever given, in 2004. Bradbury was honored with a Spoken Word Grammy nomination for his 1976 audiobook version.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAdaptations include François Truffaut\'s 1966 film adaptation of the novel and a 1982 BBC Radio dramatization. Bradbury published a stage play version in 1979 and helped develop a 1984 interactive fiction computer game titled Fahrenheit 451\', and a collection of his short stories, A Pleasure to Burn.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Plot summary</h3>\r\nFahrenheit 451 is set in an unspecified city (likely in the American Midwest) at an unspecified time in the future after the year 1960.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe novel is divided into three parts: \"The Hearth and the Salamander\", \"The Sieve and the Sand\", and \"Burning Bright\".\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The Hearth and the Salamander\"\r\nGuy Montag is a \"fireman\" employed to burn the possessions of those who read outlawed books. He is married but has no children. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. Mildred survives with no memory of what happened. Over the next days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag as he walks home. She tells him about how her interests have made her an outcast at school. Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes absent. He senses something is wrong.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman\'s suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night\'s events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, conversation that only causes him to realize how little he knows her and how little they have in common. Montag asks his wife if she has seen Clarisse recently. Mildred mutters that she believes Clarisse died after getting struck by a speeding car and that her family has moved away. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of \"The Hound\", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMontag awakens ill the next morning and stays home from work. He relates the story of the burned woman to an apathetic Mildred and mentions perhaps quitting his work. The possibility of becoming destitute from the loss of income provokes a strong reaction from her, and she says the woman herself was to blame because she had books. Captain Beatty, Montag\'s fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag\'s concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media, sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in books. The government took advantage of this, and the firemen were soon hired to burn books in the name of public happiness. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter Beatty has left, Montag reveals to Mildred that over the last year he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in their air-conditioning duct. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in their kitchen incinerator; Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned, and all will return to normal.','','/media/images/post-covers/post-3.png','left','text','fussraider','2017-02-05 15:39:19'),(4,'PHP 7.0.1 Release Announcement','The PHP development team announces the immediate availability of PHP 7.0.1.

It\'s not searchable on the Store at the moment, but the page for Modern Warfare Remastered is discoverable, and it opens the same page in the Store app, where it\'s marked as not available for separate purchase with links to two versions of Infinite Warfare that include it, the \'Digital Legacy\' and \'Digital Deluxe\' editions.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might want to think twice before you make that purchase, though: Activision\'s \"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered for Windows 10 on Windows Store\" FAQ states that Microsoft\'s edition of the game cannot be played online with versions that were purchased elsewhere.   \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Question:</u> \"Can I play Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered on Windows 10 on Windows Store with my friends that are playing on another PC platform?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Answer: </u>\"No, you can only play these titles with other users of Windows 10 on Windows Store.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\'s also not a \"Play Anywhere\" release, so buying it for the PC on the Windows Store will not get you access to the Xbox One version, and vice versa.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\'s pretty straightforward, isn\'t it? If you\'re buying it for the multiplayer—and most people probably are—then buying it from the Windows Store puts a real crimp in the number of people you can play with. (You could argue that the Steam version suffers similarly for not being compatible with the Windows Store release, I suppose, but I\'m willing to bet that the Steam playerbase will be a whole hell of lot bigger than Microsoft\'s.) \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy guess is that the Windows Store version, which is Windows 10-only, is for various technical reasons not compatible with the Windows 7-supporting version that\'s on Steam. But it\'s a bizarre situation, regardless of the specific reasons behind it. If they can\'t be made to play together, then why bother bringing the game to the Windows Store platform at all? Ultimately, all it does is shine a bright light (again) on how it falls short. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\'ve reached out to Activision for more information, and will update if and when I receive a reply. \r\n<br>','','/media/images/post-covers/post-5.jpg','right','text','fussraider','2017-02-05 15:32:15'),(6,'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea','French naturalist Dr. Aronnax embarks on an expedition to hunt down a sea monster, only to discover instead the Nautilus, a remarkable submarine built by the enigmatic Captain Nemo.
